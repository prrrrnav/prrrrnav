# Hi, I’m Pranav 👋

Backend-focused software developer with a strong interest in building **reliable, scalable, and well-structured backend systems**. I enjoy working close to system fundamentals—APIs, databases, asynchronous processing, and service reliability—rather than just surface-level features.

I’m currently pursuing a **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** and actively preparing for **backend / software engineering roles** where I can grow by working on real-world systems.

---

## 🧠 What I Care About
- Designing **correct and maintainable backend services**
- Understanding **how systems behave under load and failure**
- Writing code that is easy to reason about and operate
- Learning new stacks by mapping them to core engineering fundamentals

---

## 🔧 Tech I Work With

**Languages**
- Go, JavaScript, Java

**Backend & Distributed Systems**
- REST APIs, gRPC
- Event-driven architectures (Kafka)
- Asynchronous job processing
- Service decomposition & fault isolation

**Databases & Caching**
- PostgreSQL (schema design, indexing, transactions)
- Redis (rate limiting, caching, fast lookups)

**Security & API Design**
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting & abuse protection

**Cloud & DevOps**
- Docker, Docker Compose
- AWS EC2 (project deployments)
- Kubernetes (local development exposure)

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Event-Driven Resume ATS Analysis Platform
**Go · Kafka · gRPC · Redis · PostgreSQL · Docker**

- Designed an event-driven backend where resume analysis jobs are processed asynchronously using Kafka.
- Built concurrent Go worker services using goroutines and gRPC for efficient job execution.
- Integrated AI APIs for ATS scoring with Redis-backed caching to reduce repeated computations.
- Focused on service boundaries, fault isolation, and scalability-oriented design.

---

### 🔹 Gold — Secure Auth & Rate-Limited API Service
**Go · Redis · PostgreSQL · Docker · AWS EC2**

- Implemented a JWT-based authentication service with role-based access control.
- Built Redis-backed API rate limiting using a sliding-window strategy.
- Designed the service to be stateless, enabling horizontal scalability.
- Deployed the service on a single AWS EC2 instance using Docker for simplicity and cost efficiency.

---

## 📚 Currently Learning
- Deepening understanding of **system design and concurrency**
- Improving **code quality and review practices**
- Exploring **enterprise backend patterns** and large codebases

---

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For
- Backend / Software Engineering roles (Intern / New Grad)
- Teams that value **ownership, reliability, and learning**
- Opportunities to work on systems that matter at scale

> I believe strong fundamentals, curiosity, and ownership matter more than any single framework.
